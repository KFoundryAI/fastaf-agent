# Project Specification: FastAF Agent - Toner Supply Decision Support System

## Executive Summary
FastAF Agent is an intelligent decision support system designed for Managed Print Services (MPS) supply specialists at F.T.G. The system addresses the overwhelming volume of toner supply decisions by automatically gathering and analyzing relevant data from multiple sources, enabling specialists to process thousands of daily alerts efficiently and accurately. By providing data-driven recommendations for each alert, the system aims to reduce wasteful toner shipments by 10% and emergency overnight shipments by 50%, resulting in significant cost savings for F.T.G. and their clients.

The MVP will focus on delivering a streamlined alert processing interface with automated context gathering, decision auditing, and cost savings reporting, initially supporting 3 specialists with the capability to scale to 30+ users processing 10,000+ alerts daily.

## Problem Statement
Supply specialists at F.T.G. are overwhelmed by the sheer volume of toner alerts and orders, processing thousands of devices daily and tens of thousands weekly. The current manual process makes it impossible to review all relevant background data for each decision, leading to suboptimal supply choices. While specialists often make good decisions based on their experience, the volume prevents comprehensive data review for every alert, resulting in unnecessary shipments, wrong timing, and increased costs. This system will ensure every single supply decision is data-informed, improving accuracy and reducing waste across the entire operation.

## Target Users

- **Secondary**: 
  - Supply department supervisors (oversight and performance monitoring)
  - Finance team members (cost analysis and ROI tracking)
  - Management stakeholders (strategic decision-making based on savings reports)

  - Process millions of historical data points
- **Scale**: 
  - 3 users at launch, 30 users at full deployment
  - 1,000-10,000 alerts daily
  - Millions of historical shipment records
  - Data retention for 2+ years
- **Security**:

  - E-Automate (ERP) - Phase 2
  - Microsoft Data Warehouse - Phase 2
  - Mocked data interfaces for MVP

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Availability**: 99.5% uptime during business hours (7 AM - 7 PM EST)
- **Response Time**: Page loads < 2 seconds, alert processing < 1 second
- **Data Retention**: 2 years for audit trail, 5 years for cost reports

- **Cache**: Redis (for session management and quick data access)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Docker Compose (portable, Azure-ready)
- **External Services**: 
  - Mock data services for MVP
  - Future: FM Audit API, E-Automate API, Azure Data Warehouse
- **Deployment**: Initially Docker containers, future Azure migration

## Constraints & Assumptions
- **Budget**: Modestly funded project

- **Team Size**: Small engineering team (3-4 developers)
- **Assumptions**:
  - Users have stable internet connections
  - F.T.G. will provide access to data sources post-MVP
  - Initial testing with mocked data is acceptable
  - Toner type selection uses last-shipped type (no ML needed for MVP)
